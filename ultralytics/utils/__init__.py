    A decorator class for ensuring thread-safe execution of a function or method.

    This class can be used as a decorator to make sure that if the decorated function is called from multiple threads,
    only one thread at a time will be able to execute the function.

    Attributes:
        lock (threading.Lock): A lock object used to manage access to the decorated function.

    Examples:
        >>> from ultralytics.utils import ThreadingLocked

        >>> def my_function():
        ...    # Your code here
